* Example project

** What is this?
This project gives you an overview of how you might want to structure a Clojure web app with the [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/][system]] library.
The example project starts a web server in development mode, and a web server + remote repl in production. 
** Instructions
*** Development
Start a repl:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ lein repl
#+END_SRC

In the user namespace, type: 
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
user=> (go)
#+END_SRC

Your local web app can be found on [[http://localhost:300][localhost]] on port 3000.

*** Production
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein with-profile prod run
#+END_SRC
Your web app will be found on port 8000, and on port 8001 you will be able to connect to its repl for remote debugging.
